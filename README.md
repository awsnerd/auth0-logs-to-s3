# Auth0 - Logs to S3

[![Auth0 Extensions](http://cdn.auth0.com/extensions/assets/badge.svg)](https://sandbox.it.auth0.com/api/run/auth0-extensions/extensions-badge?webtask_no_cache=1)

This extension will take all of your Auth0 logs and export them to an AWS S3 Bucket.

## Configure Amazon Web Services

First you'll need to [create an Amazon Web Services account](https://aws.amazon.com/).

You will need to setup an IAM user with the following policy (replace your-bucket-name with an actual bucket name):

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowedActions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

> You will also need to create an S3 Bucket to put the logs into if you have not already done so.

## Configure Webtask

If you haven't configured Webtask on your machine run this first:

```
npm i -g wt-cli
wt init
```

> Requires at least node 0.10.40 - if you're running multiple version of node make sure to load the right version, e.g. "nvm use 0.10.40"

## Deploy to Webtask.io

To run it on a schedule (run every 5 minutes for example):

```
wt cron schedule \
    --name auth0-logs-to-s3 \
    --secret AUTH0_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN" \
    --secret AUTH0_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_AUTH0_GLOBAL_CLIENT_ID" \
    --secret AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_AUTH0_GLOBAL_CLIENT_SECRET" \
    --secret AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" \
    --secret AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" \
    --secret AWS_BUCKET_NAME="YOUR_AWS_BUCKET_NAME" \
    --json \
    "*/5 * * * *" \
    ./build/bundle.js
```

There are optional properties you can set (here they are with their defaults).
```
    --secret AWS_REGION="us-west-2" \
    --secret BATCH_SIZE="100" \
```

> You can get your Global Client Id/Secret here: https://auth0.com/docs/api/v1

## Usage

Use any Storage Explorer to access your logs. Each record will be saved in the following structure:

```
{YOUR_AWS_BUCKET_NAME}/YYYY/MM/DD/HH/{LOG_ID}.json
```

This will allow you to process the logs with Stream Analytics for example (which in turn can export them to Power BI).

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
